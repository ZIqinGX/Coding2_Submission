Sound and Image is linked. Mouse can control the shape gernerated ass well.
One of the addons used is ofxMaxiliam. It generate the sound in this work. I downloaded addon from:https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian
Another addon is ofxVectorGraphics. I found it in example of openframework. It controls the change of visual part.

### Labwork3 Python challenge (python puzzles)


In this homework, I designed four puzzles needed to be solved by python. The puzzles here require the use of sorting in Python, searching in order, printing the results, finding information in specified rows and columns, converting to ASCII using Python, and operating on stacks.
For complete Python challenge, you can check jupyter notebook

### Labwork4 Python Image dataset exercise (python average pics)

In  this python image exercise, I tried download 60 pictures with same theme--flowers with python, saved them into a new directory. Then average them with different numpy functions. I tried different numbers of source images with same function and I also added some decimal numbers to the original operations, and added the results obtained from different numpy functions together to generate a new image and create different effects. The following are two of them, you can open my jupyternotebook for more effects
